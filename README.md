# GPR-250-Midterm-Project
A project that I did in my GPR-250 Game Architecture class in the spring semester of 2023. 

The project was to make a simple game where projectiles will fire out from the center of the screen and head towards the edges. The goal of the player is to click on the projectiles to turn them blue. 
When the projectiles reach the edge of the screen, if they are clicked they will add to the score. If they are not clicked they will subtract from the score. If the score reaches 0 the game ends.

It was programmed using C++ and the Allegro Library. In the class, we were also using a Library made by our professor. 

Note: Everything under the shared folder is not my work, and was provided to the class by our instructor. Everything under the project folder is my work. 

This is here on Github to act as my Portfolio and is not an ongoing project which is why it is archived.
